# PHYS4211 Homework

These are my homework solutions to Physics 4211, also known as Computational Physics, at the University of New Orleans. These are written in Python. All plots will be posted in this readme with the description of the problem.

My homework is primary to recreate plots from Nicholas J. Giordano and Hisao Nakanishi. Computational Physics, 2nd edition,			

Figure 2.2: The task was to plot the velocity of a cyclist with constant power output, with and without air resistance. The equations can be found in the book.
